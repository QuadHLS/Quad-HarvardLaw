# QuadHLS

QuadHLS is an integrated digital platform designed for Harvard Law School students. It brings together academic resources, campus communication, and student life tools into a single, centralized system.

Law school information is often fragmented across shared drives, spreadsheets, and group chats. QuadHLS consolidates these resources into one platform to make it easier for students to stay organized, collaborate effectively, and access institutional knowledge.
